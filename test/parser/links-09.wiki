The character '''tilde''' (~) is used 
when adding a comment to a Talk page. 
You should sign your comment by 
appending four tildes (~~~~)
to the comment so as to add your 
user name plus date/time:
: ~~~~
Adding three tildes (~~~) will add 
just your user name:
: ~~~
and adding five tildes (~~~~~) gives 
the date/time alone:
: ~~~~~
